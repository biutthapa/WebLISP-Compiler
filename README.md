# The WebLISP Compiler
The WebLISP compiler repository will contain the source code for the compiler that will transform the WebLISP source code into the WebAssembly bytecode. The compiler is implemented in a hybrid approach that combines the best features of interpreted and compiled languages to provide a high-performance output. It will take advantage of the latest browser technologies to deliver fast and reliable performance.

## Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to create a high-performance, easy-to-use language that is specifically designed for building games and other heavy applications that run in the browser. We believe that by leveraging the power of WebAssembly and taking a hybrid approach to compiling and interpreting code, we can achieve this goal and create a language that is faster and more efficient than any other language for building browser-based applications.

## Features
The WebLISP Compiler will include the following features:
- A hybrid approach to compiling and interpreting WebLISP code for maximum performance
- Code specialization techniques to optimize WebLISP for specific types of apps and games
- Voxel-based rendering for fast, efficient rendering of complex 3D scenes
- Integration with popular game engines and frameworks
- A powerful standard library that includes everything a game engine should be able to do
- Syntax inspired by Clojure
- Full support for breakpoints and debugging in all major IDEs through plugins

## Future Work
While this repository is currently empty, there is a lot of work to be done to achieve our goals. Some of the tasks that we will be working on in the future include:

Implementing the WebLISP parser and interpreter
Building a suite of test cases to ensure the language is functioning correctly
Developing the WebLISP standard library
Creating IDE plugins to support debugging and breakpoints
Integrating with popular game engines and frameworks

## Conclusion
We believe that WebLISP has the potential to revolutionize the way we build browser-based applications. With its high performance, powerful features, and ease-of-use, we believe that WebLISP will become the go-to language for building games and other high-performance applications that run in the browser. Thank you for your interest in the project, and we look forward to working with you to make WebLISP a reality!
